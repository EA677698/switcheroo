# Switcheroo

**Switcheroo** is a static C++ library that recompiles **ARMv8-A instructions** into **x86-64** machine code.  Switcheroo is designed to be used as either a static or JIT (Just-In-Time) recompiler.

## WIP Features

- Converts ARMv8-A instructions to equivalent x86-64 instructions
- Supports base Aarch64 ISA
- Built as a static library for easy integration
- Supports MSVC (Windows), GCC/Clang (Linux/macOS)
